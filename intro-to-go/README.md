# An Introduction to Go

Here are some slides from a workshop introducing Go.

To view the slides, you will need an installation of [Go][go] and the `present`
tool.

To install `present`, run:

```
go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
```

Then, from the directory with the `slide` file, run:

```
present
```

And then visit `localhost:3999` to view the slides.
